## requirements
Provide a brief motivation at the beginning, annotate each visualization appropriately, and then provide brief policy-relevant conclusions.

Do households value transit-rich neighborhoods compared to others? How certain can you be about your conclusions given some of the spatial biases we've discussed? 

1.Show your data wrangling work.
2.Four small-multiple (2000 & 2017+) visualizations comparing four selected Census variables across time and space (TOD vs. non-TOD).
3.One grouped bar plot making these same comparisons.
4.One table making these same comparisons.
5.Create two graduated symbol maps of population and rent within 0.5 mile of each transit station. Google for more 6.information, but a graduate symbol map represents quantities for each transit station proportionally.
7.Create a geom_line plot that shows mean rent as a function of distance to subway stations (Figure x.x.x). To do this you will need to use the multipleRingBuffer function in the ppaR package.
8.Download and wrangle point-level crime data (pick a crime type). What is the relationship between crime, transit access and rents

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
